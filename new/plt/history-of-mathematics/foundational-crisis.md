# Foundational Crisis in Mathematics

Models for effective computability:

- Alonzo Church - Lambda calculus
- Kurt Go&#x308;del - General recursive (&mu;-recursive) functions
- Alan Turing - Turing machines

(Wadler, 2015) [^1]: "It's like buses &mdash; you wait two thousand years for a definition of effective computability, and then three come along at once."

Timeline:
??? - Hilbert introduces Hilbert's program:

- completeness - every true statement is provable
- consistency - for any statement P, both P and &not;P are not simultaneously true
- decidability - there is an algorithm that can decide for any statement whether it is true or false. Also known as the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem).

1930 - Go&#x308;del's first incompleteness theorem
Statements of formal logic can be encoded as natural numbers using Go&#x308;del numbering.
RESULT: If a formal system can represent natural numbers, addition (+) and multiplication (&times;) (e.g. Peano arithmetic), there are statements that are true but not provable.
